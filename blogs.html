             <p>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of
                different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers
                to occupy the
                space which will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final
                text is not
                yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'.

            <p> blog by Ritik  </p>
            <p>My college life is the best part of my life because I gained so many beautiful memories and so many
                friends who will be connected to me my whole life. I studied in SDBCE university which had a good
                infrastructure and good hostels too. But remember, we are bachelors and we are made to annoy the
                wardens.

            <p><h3>Chasing dream not happiness</h3>
                Our lives are very busy and many of us are so much indulge in work that we dont have time for
                ourselves, we all have dreams and we all chase it to achieve it. Chasing dream is good but what if I tell you
                that you are chasing dreams to fulfill your goal, your desires and want to become happy, because at the end of
                every dream , when you achieve it, you become happy, so that make your end goal to become happy.
